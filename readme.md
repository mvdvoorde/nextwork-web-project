DevOps 7 Days
This is me trying out a course on learn.nextwork.org to see how much knowledge I already have to become a DevOps engineer, (Maybe DevSecOps not sure yet)

Day 1
Introduction to DevOps and getting resources in the cloud set up

Set everything up on AWS side -- EC2 instance -- IAM User -- ssh key (pem file) to connect remotely
Install VS code
Install packages on the new EC2 instance (Maven, Java)
Day 2
Using GitHub to store our code somewhere

Setup Remote Git repository
install git package on EC2
Setup token to write to git
make changes to application and commit to get git knowledge
